# Presidential-Speech-and-Tweets-Analysis

The primary goal of this project is to show results of a comprehensive comparison of two American Presidents through their speeches obtained by applying NLP techniques. In addition to this, this report includes analysis of Donald Trump’s tweets as he is considered to be the most active President on twitter till date. These goals are achieved using text mining techniques.
Text mining is the process of examining large collections of documents to discover new information or help answer specific research questions.
It help identify facts, relationships and assertions that would otherwise remain buried in the mass of textual big data. Once extracted, this information is converted into a structured form that can be further analyzed, or presented directly using tables, network diagrams, charts, word clouds etc. Text mining employs a variety of methodologies to process the text, one of the most important of these being Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Data source: This project uses two datasets, the transcripts of the speeches and tweets. The first dataset has been curated by selecting transcripts available on various websites like usnews.com and the second dataset is curated by exporting tweets from ​thetrumparchive.com​ for the dates of the Trump Administration.
